<p>Welcome, employees and office drones!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Things are moving at CORP. HQ! This is our first newsletter, we have recently made our pens available to subscribers on our bandcamp, lyrics are almost all available on streaming platforms like Spotify (our hard-working employees have yet to finish the job), and we put together this song breakdown of "Escape the Rat"!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here's an exclusive sneak peak at the breakdown before it's released to wider audiences:</p>

<p>Please make sure to enjoy the full duration of the video equally.</p>

<p>Finally, in this time of change, please get in touch and let us know what you would like to see in future emails from CORP.!</p>
