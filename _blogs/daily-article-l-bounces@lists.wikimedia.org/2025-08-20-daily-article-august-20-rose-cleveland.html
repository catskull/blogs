subject: "[Daily article] August 20: Rose Cleveland"
---
<p>Rose Cleveland (1846–1918) was the acting first lady of the United</p>
<p>States from 1885 to 1886, during the first presidency of her brother,</p>
<p>Grover Cleveland, until his wedding with Frances Folsom in 1886.</p>
<p>Receiving an advanced education in her youth, Rose Cleveland rejected</p>
<p>traditional gender norms and worked in literary and academic positions.</p>
<p>She used the role of first lady as a platform for her support of women's</p>
<p>suffrage. After leaving the White House, Cleveland authored several</p>
<p>fiction and nonfiction works, many relating to women's rights. She was</p>
<p>editor of a literary magazine, and continued teaching and lecturing. She</p>
<p>met Evangeline Marrs Simpson in 1889, and the two became romantic</p>
<p>partners, interrupted for several years by Simpson's marriage to Henry</p>
<p>Benjamin Whipple. After reuniting, they moved to Italy in 1910. There,</p>
<p>Cleveland spent her final years aiding refugees during World War I and</p>
<p>cared for Spanish flu patients before contracting the disease herself</p>
<p>and dying in 1918.</p>

<p>Wikiquote quote of the day:</p>
<p></p>
<p>      I believe in tension and release, in that if you stay in the the</p>
<p>same tone and mode and intensity for too long, it actually becomes</p>
<p>monotonous. When you change up your pace or your humour level, then the</p>
<p>release is welcome. … I believe that's my biggest job: tone control,</p>
<p>and maintaining enough unity so that it all feels like one movie and all</p>
<p>the scenes belong together, and yet diversity so that emotional and</p>
<p>narrative interest is maintained.      </p>
