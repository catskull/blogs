<p>Proceratosaurus is a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived during the</p>
<p>Middle Jurassic in what is now England. The holotype and only known</p>
<p>specimen (pictured) consists of a mostly complete skull with an</p>
<p>accompanying lower jaw and a hyoid bone, found near Minchinhampton, a</p>
<p>town in Gloucestershire. It was originally described as a species of</p>
<p>Megalosaurus, M. bradleyi, in 1910, but was moved to its own genus in</p>
<p>1926. The genus was named after a supposed close relationship with</p>
<p>Ceratosaurus, later shown to be erroneous, due to the presence of an</p>
<p>incomplete cranial crest considered to resemble Ceratosaurus's nasal</p>
<p>horn. Proceratosaurus is now considered to be one of the oldest members</p>
<p>of Tyrannosauroidea (the broader group that includes the tyrannosaurids,</p>
<p>including Tyrannosaurus). During the Bathonian age when Proceratosaurus</p>
<p>lived, Britain and the rest of Western Europe formed a subtropical</p>
<p>island archipelago, with contemporary dinosaurs including stegosaurs,</p>
<p>Megalosaurus and Cetiosaurus.</p>

<p>Wikiquote quote of the day:</p>
<p></p>
<p>      Perhaps indeed the possession of wealth is constantly</p>
<p>distressing,  But I should be quite willing to assume every curse of</p>
<p>wealth if I could at the same time assume every blessing.  The only</p>
<p>incurable troubles of the rich are the troubles that money can't cure,</p>
<p>Which is a kind of trouble that is even more troublesome if you are</p>
<p>poor.      </p>
