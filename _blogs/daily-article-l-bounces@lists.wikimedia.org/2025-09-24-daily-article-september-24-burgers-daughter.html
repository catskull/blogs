subject: "[Daily article] September 24: Burger's Daughter"
---
<p>Burger's Daughter is a novel by the South African writer Nadine Gordimer</p>
<p>(pictured). Set in the mid-1970s, it details a group of white anti-</p>
<p>apartheid activists seeking to overthrow the South African government.</p>
<p>It follows the life of Rosa Burger as she comes to terms with her</p>
<p>father's legacy as an activist in the South African Communist Party.</p>
<p>Gordimer was involved in South African politics and knew Bram Fischer,</p>
<p>Nelson Mandela's treason trial defence lawyer. She modelled the novel's</p>
<p>Burger family on Fischer's family and described Burger's Daughter as an</p>
<p>homage to Fischer. The novel was first published in the United Kingdom</p>
<p>in 1979. It was banned in South Africa a month after its publication,</p>
<p>and its import and sale were prohibited by the South African</p>
<p>Publications Control Board. Three months later, the Publications Appeal</p>
<p>Board overturned the ban and restrictions were lifted. The novel was</p>
<p>generally well received by critics and won the Central News Agency</p>
<p>Literary Award in 1980.</p>

<p>Wikiquote quote of the day:</p>
<p></p>
<p>      It is emphatically the province and duty of the Judicial</p>
<p>Department to say what the law is. Those who apply the rule to</p>
<p>particular cases must, of necessity, expound and interpret that rule. If</p>
<p>two laws conflict with each other, the Courts must decide on the</p>
<p>operation of each.  So, if a law be in opposition to the Constitution,</p>
<p>if both the law and the Constitution apply to a particular case, so that</p>
<p>the Court must either decide that case conformably to the law,</p>
<p>disregarding the Constitution, or conformably to the Constitution,</p>
<p>disregarding the law, the Court must determine which of these</p>
<p>conflicting rules governs the case. This is of the very essence of</p>
<p>judicial duty.  If, then, the Courts are to regard the Constitution, and</p>
<p>the Constitution is superior to any ordinary act of the Legislature, the</p>
<p>Constitution, and not such ordinary act, must govern the case to which</p>
<p>they both apply.      </p>
