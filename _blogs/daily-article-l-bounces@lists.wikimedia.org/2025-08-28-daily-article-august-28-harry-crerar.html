<p>Wikiquote quote of the day:</p>
<p></p>
<p>      This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take</p>
<p>the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the</p>
<p>promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and</p>
<p>desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now</p>
<p>is the time to open the doors of opportunity to all of God's children.</p>
<p>Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial</p>
<p>injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make</p>
<p>justice a reality for all of God's children.      </p>
