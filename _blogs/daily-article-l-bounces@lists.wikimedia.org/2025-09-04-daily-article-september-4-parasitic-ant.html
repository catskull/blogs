subject: "[Daily article] September 4: Parasitic ant"
---
<p>A parasitic ant is a type of ant that exploits the social structure of</p>
<p>another ant species for its own survival and reproduction. The most</p>
<p>common types of parasitic ants infiltrate a colony of a closely related</p>
<p>species by using pheromones identical to those of the colony's workers</p>
<p>to avoid conflict and blend in. The parasite lays eggs alongside</p>
<p>existing ones for the host colony's worker ants to raise and nurture.</p>
<p>Other parasitic ants transport the host colony's pupae and larvae back</p>
<p>to the parasite's colony, where the brood will be raised as their own.</p>
<p>The host brood that were transported are unable to differentiate between</p>
<p>the parasites and their own colony, and serve as worker ants for the</p>
<p>parasites. Some parasites have adapted their anatomy to reflect that of</p>
<p>the hosts, allowing them to remain undetected for much of their</p>
<p>lifespans. Parasites usually cause harmful effects to the target colony</p>
<p>and can inhibit the colony's growth and development.</p>
