---
<p>Satsu is a fictional character in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer comics.</p>
<p>She first appears in Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight No. 1</p>
<p>(2007), a canonical continuation of the television series Buffy the</p>
<p>Vampire Slayer. Buffy Summers is a slayer, a fighter of supernatural</p>
<p>foes. Satsu is activated as a slayer, trained by Buffy, and falls in</p>
<p>love with her. They have sex together twice before Satsu returns to</p>
<p>Japan. In later storylines, Satsu struggles to move on from Buffy,</p>
<p>fights demonically-possessed stuffed animals, and briefly reappears in</p>
<p>Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten. Satsu was developed by Buffy's</p>
<p>creator Joss Whedon (pictured) and artist Georges Jeanty. Critics, fans,</p>
<p>and industry insiders had a mixed response to Satsu's sexual</p>
<p>relationship with Buffy. Academics have analyzed the unequal power</p>
<p>dynamic between Satsu and Buffy, compared the representations of their</p>
<p>sexuality, and discussed the depiction of Satsu's race and ethnicity.</p>

<p>Wikiquote quote of the day:</p>
<p></p>
<p>      One percent of the nation owns a third of the wealth. The rest of</p>
<p>the wealth is distributed in such a way as to turn those in the 99</p>
<p>percent against one another: small property owners against the</p>
<p>propertyless, black against white, native-born against foreign-born,</p>
<p>intellectuals and professionals against the uneducated and the</p>
<p>unskilled. These groups have resented one another and warred against one</p>
<p>another with such vehemence and violence as to obscure their common</p>
<p>position as sharers of leftovers in a very wealthy country.      </p>
