<p>T4 was a seagoing torpedo boat operated by the Royal Yugoslav Navy</p>
<p>between 1921 and 1932. Originally built in 1914 for the Austro-Hungarian</p>
<p>Navy as a 250t-class torpedo boat, she saw active service during World</p>
<p>War I, performing convoy, patrol, escort and minesweeping tasks, anti-</p>
<p>submarine operations and shore bombardment missions. Following Austria-</p>
<p>Hungary's defeat in 1918, she was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom</p>
<p>of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which later became the Royal Yugoslav</p>
<p>Navy, and was renamed T4. During the interwar period, T4 and the rest of</p>
<p>the navy were involved in training exercises and cruises to friendly</p>
<p>ports. In 1932, she ran aground on the island of Drvenik Mali off the</p>
<p>central Dalmatian coast and the hull broke in half. The bow remained on</p>
<p>the island, and the stern was towed to the Tivat Arsenal in the Bay of</p>
<p>Kotor. (This article is part of a featured topic: Ships of the Royal</p>

<p>Wikiquote quote of the day:</p>
<p></p>
<p>      It is good to know that our nation's defenses against a</p>
<p>conventional attack are impregnable, and an imperative that America</p>
<p>remain vigilant against threats from terrorists. But as is the case with</p>
<p>a human being, admirable characteristics of a nation are not defined by</p>
<p>size and physical prowess. What are some of the other attributes of a</p>
<p>superpower? Once again, they might very well mirror those of a person.</p>
<p>These would include a demonstrable commitment to truth, justice, peace,</p>
<p>freedom, humility, human rights, generosity, and the upholding of other</p>
<p>moral values.      </p>
