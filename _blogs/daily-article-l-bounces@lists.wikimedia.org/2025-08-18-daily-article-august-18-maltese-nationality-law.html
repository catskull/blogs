subject: "[Daily article] August 18: Maltese nationality law"
---
<p>Maltese nationality law is primarily governed by the Maltese Citizenship</p>
<p>Act, which came into force on 21 September 1964. All persons born in</p>
<p>Malta between 21 September 1964 and 1 August 1989 automatically</p>
<p>received citizenship at birth regardless of the nationalities of their</p>
<p>parents. Individuals born in the country since that date receive Maltese</p>
<p>citizenship at birth if at least one of their parents was a Maltese</p>
<p>citizen or was born in Malta. Foreign nationals may become Maltese</p>
<p>citizens by naturalisation after meeting a minimum residence requirement</p>
<p>(usually five years). Malta is a member state of the European Union, and</p>
<p>all Maltese nationals are European Union citizens. Maltese citizens are</p>
<p>also Commonwealth citizens under British law.</p>

<p>Wikiquote quote of the day:</p>
<p></p>
<p>      Writers must fortify themselves with pride and egotism as best</p>
<p>they can. The process is analogous to using sandbags and loose timbers</p>
<p>to protect a house against flood. Writers are vulnerable creatures like</p>
<p>anyone else. For what do they have in reality? Not sandbags, not</p>
<p>timbers. Just a flimsy reputation and a name.      </p>
