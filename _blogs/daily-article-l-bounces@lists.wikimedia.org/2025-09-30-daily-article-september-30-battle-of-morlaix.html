---
<p>The battle of Morlaix was fought in Brittany on 30 September 1342</p>
<p>between an Anglo-Breton army under William, Earl of Northampton, and a</p>
<p>far larger Franco-Breton force led by Charles of Blois (pictured).</p>
<p>England and France, fighting the Hundred Years' War since 1337, had each</p>
<p>sided with a faction in the Breton Civil War. The English had prepared a</p>
<p>defensive position and when the first of three French divisions advanced</p>
<p>it was shot to pieces by English archers using longbows. The second</p>
<p>division, of men-at-arms, attacked but their charge was halted when they</p>
<p>fell into a camouflaged ditch. Presented with a large, close-range</p>
<p>target the English archers inflicted many casualties. The English then</p>
<p>withdrew into a wood to their rear, which the French besieged, possibly</p>
<p>for several days, before Northampton broke out with a night attack. This</p>
<p>was the first major land battle of the Hundred Years' War and the</p>
<p>tactics used foreshadowed those of both the French and the English for</p>
<p>the rest of the 1340s.</p>

<p>Wikiquote quote of the day:</p>
<p></p>
<p>      Once you label a people "illegal", that is exactly what the Nazis</p>
<p>did to Jews. You do not label a people "illegal." They have committed an</p>
<p>illegal act. They are immigrants who crossed illegally. They are</p>
<p>immigrants who crossed without papers. They are immigrants who crossed</p>
<p>without permission. They are living in this country without permission.</p>
<p>But they are not an illegal people.      </p>
