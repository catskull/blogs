<p>William Arthur Ganfield (September 3, 1873 – October 18, 1940) was</p>
<p>an American minister, educator, and academic administrator. He was</p>
<p>ordained in 1901 and began his first preaching role later that year in</p>
<p>Green Bay, Wisconsin. He became a professor at Carroll College (now</p>
<p>Carroll University) in 1905 and taught there until he was elected</p>
<p>president of Centre College in 1915. During his six-year term, he helped</p>
<p>Centre's enrollment recover from a lull and grew the school's endowment</p>
<p>past $1 million for the first time, in part by reinstating ties between</p>
<p>the college and the Presbyterian Church. He returned to Carroll as its</p>
<p>president in 1921 and oversaw a strengthening of requirements for</p>
<p>professors and implementing tenure, pensions and a fixed salary for</p>
<p>faculty. Ganfield supported sports at both schools: Centre's football</p>
<p>team won a major upset victory over Harvard in 1921, and Carroll's</p>
<p>football and basketball teams each won multiple league championships</p>
<p>during his term.</p>
