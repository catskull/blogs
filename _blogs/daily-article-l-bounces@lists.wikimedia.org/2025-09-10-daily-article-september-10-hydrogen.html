subject: "[Daily article] September 10: Hydrogen"
---
<p>Hydrogen is a chemical element with the symbol H and atomic number 1.</p>
<p>It is the lightest and most abundant element, constituting about 75% of</p>
<p>all normal matter. The Sun is mainly hydrogen in a plasma state. Under</p>
<p>standard conditions, hydrogen is a gas of diatomic molecules with the</p>
<p>formula H2; it is colorless, odorless, non-toxic and highly combustible.</p>
<p>On Earth, hydrogen can exist in its gaseous state and in molecular</p>
<p>forms, such as with oxygen in water (H2O). The most common isotope of</p>
<p>hydrogen (1H) consists of one proton, one electron and no neutrons.</p>
<p>Hydrogen gas was first produced artificially by the reaction of acids</p>
<p>with metals. Henry Cavendish, in 1766–1781, identified hydrogen gas as</p>
<p>a distinct substance and discovered its property of producing water when</p>
<p>burned; its name means water-former in Greek. Its main industrial uses</p>
<p>include fossil-fuel processing and ammonia production for fertilizer.</p>
<p>Emerging uses for hydrogen include the use of fuel cells to generate</p>
<p>electricity.</p>
