<p>The red wattlebird is a passerine bird native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>With a length of 33–37 cm (13–14½ in), it is the second largest</p>
<p>species of Australian honeyeater. It has mainly grey-brown plumage, with</p>
<p>red eyes, distinctive pinkish-red wattles on either side of the neck,</p>
<p>white streaks on the chest and a large bright yellow patch on the lower</p>
<p>belly. Loud and conspicuous, the red wattlebird is generally found in</p>
<p>trees, where it gets most of its food; occasionally it forages on the</p>
<p>ground. It is one of the largest nectarivorous birds in the world,</p>
<p>feeding from a wide variety of flowering plants. Insects also comprise</p>
<p>part of its diet. It is territorial and at times aggressive towards</p>
<p>birds of other species, often defending rich sources of nectar. Breeding</p>
<p>throughout its range, the red wattlebird builds a cup-shaped nest in a</p>
<p>tree and raises one or two broods a year. Although it has declined in</p>
<p>places from land clearing, it is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN</p>
<p>Red List.</p>
