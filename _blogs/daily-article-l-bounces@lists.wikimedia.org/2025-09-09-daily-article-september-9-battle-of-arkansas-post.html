---
<p>The Battle of Arkansas Post was fought from January 9 to 11, 1863,</p>
<p>along the Arkansas River at Arkansas Post, Arkansas, as part of the</p>
<p>Vicksburg campaign of the American Civil War. Major General Ulysses S.</p>
<p>Grant of the Union army started to move against Vicksburg in</p>
<p>November 1862. He entrusted William T. Sherman with command of the</p>
<p>riverine movement towards Vicksburg, rather than John A. McClernand,</p>
<p>whom Grant did not trust. Initial advances stalled, and McClernand</p>
<p>arrived and took command in early January 1863. On January 10, 1863,</p>
<p>Union warships bombarded Arkansas Post. At 1:00 pm on January 11,</p>
<p>Union forces again attacked, by land and water. The land attack was</p>
<p>repulsed, but the Confederates agreed to surrender. When Grant learned</p>
<p>of the operation against Arkansas Post, he disapproved, but he was later</p>
<p>convinced of the wisdom of the operation. The siege of Vicksburg ended</p>
<p>with a Confederate surrender on July 4, 1863, a key contribution to the</p>
<p>eventual Union victory.</p>
