<p>20 Exchange Place is a skyscraper in the Financial District of Lower</p>
<p>Manhattan, New York City. Completed in 1931, it was designed by Cross &</p>
<p>Cross as the headquarters of the City Bank–Farmers Trust Company,</p>
<p>predecessor of Citigroup. The building, standing at approximately 741</p>
<p>feet (226 m) with 57 usable stories, was one of New York City's tallest</p>
<p>buildings and the world's tallest stone-clad building upon its</p>
<p>completion. The building has a granite and limestone facade, while its</p>
<p>internal superstructure is made of steel. The lower section of the</p>
<p>facade fills the entirety of an irregular quadrilateral city block and</p>
<p>contains piers with figures depicting the "giants of finance". The upper</p>
<p>stories, consisting of a square tower with chamfered corners, are offset</p>
<p>from the base. The building is an official New York City landmark and a</p>
<p>contributing property to the Wall Street Historic District.</p>
