<p>Bad Times at the El Royale is a 2018 American neo-noir, hyperlink,</p>
<p>thriller film written, directed, and produced by Drew Goddard</p>
<p>(pictured). The film follows six strangers and an employee at the El</p>
<p>Royale, a hotel located on the California–Nevada border, on a night in</p>
<p>the late 1960s, exploring themes of morality, faith, redemption, and the</p>
<p>concepts of right and wrong. Principal photography began on January 29,</p>
<p>2018, with cinematographer Seamus McGarvey, and concluded on April 6.</p>
<p>Post-production editing was completed by Lisa Lassek and the musical</p>
<p>score was composed by Michael Giacchino. The film underperformed at the</p>
<p>box office, grossing $31.8 million against its $32 million production</p>
<p>budget. Despite this, critics praised the soundtrack, performances of</p>
<p>the cast, and McGarvey's cinematography, although they criticized its</p>
<p>pacing, runtime, character beats, and Goddard’s writing. At the 45th</p>
<p>Saturn Awards, the film received five nominations and won for Best</p>
<p>Thriller Film.</p>
