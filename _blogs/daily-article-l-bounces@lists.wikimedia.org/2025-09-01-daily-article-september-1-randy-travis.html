---
<p>Randy Travis (born 1959) is an American country and gospel music singer</p>
<p>and songwriter. He has recorded more than 20 studio albums and charted</p>
<p>more than 50 singles on Billboard's Hot Country Songs charts, including</p>
<p>16 that reached the number-one position. Travis's commercial success</p>
<p>began in the mid-1980s with the release of his album Storms of Life,</p>
<p>which was certified triple-platinum by the Recording Industry</p>
<p>Association of America. His major songs include "On the Other Hand",</p>
<p>"Forever and Ever, Amen", "I Told You So", "Hard Rock Bottom of Your</p>
<p>Heart", and "Three Wooden Crosses". Travis is noted as a key figure in</p>
<p>the neotraditional country movement, a return to more traditional sounds</p>
<p>within the genre following the country pop crossovers of the early</p>
<p>1980s. Since surviving a near-fatal stroke in 2013, which severely</p>
<p>limited his singing and speaking ability, he has released archival</p>
<p>recordings and made limited public appearances.</p>

<p>      There are two Births, the one when Light  First strikes the new</p>
<p>awak’ned sense;The Other when two Souls unite;  And we must count</p>
<p>our life from thence:When you lov’d me, and I lov’d you,Then both of</p>
<p>us were born anew.      </p>
