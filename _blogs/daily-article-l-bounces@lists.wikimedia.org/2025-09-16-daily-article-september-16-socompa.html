<p>Socompa is a large stratovolcano (composite volcano) on the border of</p>
<p>Argentina and Chile. It has an elevation of 6,051 metres (19,852 ft)</p>
<p>and is part of the Chilean and Argentine Andean Volcanic Belt. Socompa</p>
<p>lies close to the pass of the same name where the Salta–Antofagasta</p>
<p>railway crosses the border. Most of the northwestern slope of Socompa</p>
<p>collapsed catastrophically 7,200 years ago to form an extensive debris</p>
<p>avalanche deposit. The Socompa collapse is among the largest known on</p>
<p>land with a volume of 19.2 cubic kilometres (4.6 cu mi) and a surface</p>
<p>area of 490 square kilometres (190 sq mi). After the volcanic landslide,</p>
<p>Socompa was rebuilt by the effusion of lava flows and much of the scar</p>
<p>is now filled in. Socompa is also noteworthy for the high-altitude</p>
<p>biotic communities that are bound to fumaroles on the mountain. They are</p>
<p>well above the sparse regular vegetation in the region, which does not</p>
<p>extend up the mountains. The climate on the mountain is cold and dry.</p>
