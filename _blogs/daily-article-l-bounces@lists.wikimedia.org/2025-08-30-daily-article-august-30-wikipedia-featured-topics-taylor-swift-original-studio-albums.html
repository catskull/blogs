<p>Taylor Swift is the debut studio album by the American singer-songwriter</p>
<p>Taylor Swift (pictured), released on October 24, 2006, by Big Machine</p>
<p>Records. Swift wrote or co-wrote all the tracks of the album, based on</p>
<p>her experiences as a teenager; its lyrics address love, friendship, and</p>
<p>insecurity. Produced by Nathan Chapman, it is a country record with pop</p>
<p>and pop rock influences, using acoustic arrangements composed of</p>
<p>guitars, banjos, and fiddles. Critics generally praised the earnest</p>
<p>teenage feelings portrayed in Taylor Swift, and it spent more weeks on</p>
<p>the US Billboard 200 than any other album of the 2000s decade. Among</p>
<p>its singles, "Our Song" and "Should've Said No" peaked atop the US Hot</p>
<p>Country Songs chart, while "Teardrops on My Guitar" became Swift's first</p>
<p>crossover success on the pop charts.  Rolling Stone featured it in their</p>
<p>2022 list "100 Best Debut Albums of All Time". (This article is part of</p>

<p>Wikiquote quote of the day:</p>
<p></p>
<p>      We should be looking to trade with the rest of the world. We</p>
<p>should do what we do best, and they should do what they do best.  With</p>
<p>eight countries possessing nuclear weapons, including a few I would call</p>
<p>quite unstable, I don't think it's a great idea to design a world where</p>
<p>a few countries say, "Haha, we've won" while other countries are</p>
<p>envious. … The main thing is that trade should not be a weapon.  The</p>
<p>more prosperous the rest of the world becomes, it won't be at our</p>
<p>expense — the more prosperous we'll become and the safer we'll feel</p>
<p>and your children will feel someday.      </p>
