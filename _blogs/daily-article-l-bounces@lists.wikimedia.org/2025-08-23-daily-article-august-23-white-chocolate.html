subject: "[Daily article] August 23: White chocolate"
---
<p>White chocolate is a chocolate made from cocoa butter, sugar and milk</p>
<p>solids. It is ivory in color as it does not contain the non-fat</p>
<p>components of cocoa (cocoa solids). Of the three traditional types of</p>
<p>chocolate (the others being milk and dark), white chocolate is the least</p>
<p>popular; its taste and texture are divisive. White chocolate is sold in</p>
<p>a variety of forms and it is common for manufacturers to pair white</p>
<p>chocolate with other flavors. White chocolate is made industrially in a</p>
<p>five-step process. The ingredients are mixed to form a paste; the paste</p>
<p>is refined, reducing the particle size to a powder; then agitated for</p>
<p>several hours (known as conching); further processing standardizes its</p>
<p>viscosity and taste; and the chocolate is tempered by heating, cooling</p>
<p>and then reheating. White chocolate was first sold commercially in</p>
<p>tablet form in 1936 by the Swiss company Nestlé. It was not until the</p>
<p>1980s that white chocolate became popular in the United States.</p>

<p>Wikiquote quote of the day:</p>
<p></p>
<p>      The Smithsonian is OUT OF CONTROL, where everything discussed is</p>
<p>how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was, and how unaccomplished</p>
<p>the downtrodden have been — Nothing about Success, nothing about</p>
<p>Brightness, nothing about the Future. We are not going to allow this to</p>
<p>happen, and I have instructed my attorneys to go through the Museums,</p>
<p>and start the exact same process that has been done with Colleges and</p>
<p>Universities where tremendous progress has been made. This Country</p>
<p>cannot be WOKE, because WOKE IS BROKE.      </p>
