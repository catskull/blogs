<p>SMS Rheinland was one of four Nassau-class battleships, the first</p>
<p>dreadnoughts built for the Imperial German Navy and launched on</p>
<p>September 26, 1908. Her service with the High Seas Fleet during World</p>
<p>War I included fleet advances into the North Sea, some in support of</p>
<p>raids by I Scouting Group as well as the Battle of Jutland, in which</p>
<p>Rheinland was engaged by British destroyers. The ship also saw duty in</p>
<p>the Baltic Sea during the Battle of the Gulf of Riga. She returned to</p>
<p>the Baltic as the core of an expeditionary force to aid the White Finns</p>
<p>in the Finnish Civil War in 1918, but ran aground. The damage done by</p>
<p>the grounding was too severe and Rheinland was decommissioned to be used</p>
<p>as a barracks ship for the remainder of the war. In 1919, following the</p>
<p>scuttling of the German fleet at Scapa Flow, Rheinland was ceded to the</p>
<p>Allies who, in turn, sold the vessel to ship breakers in the Netherlands</p>
<p>to eventually be broken up to scrap metal. (This article is part of a</p>

<p>Wikiquote quote of the day:</p>
<p></p>
<p>      Trying to use words, and every attempt  Is a wholly new start,</p>
<p>and a different kind of failure  Because one has only learnt to get the</p>
<p>better of words  For the thing one no longer has to say, or the way in</p>
<p>which  One is no longer disposed to say it.      </p>
