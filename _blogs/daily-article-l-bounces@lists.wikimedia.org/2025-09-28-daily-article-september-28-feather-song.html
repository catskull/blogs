<p>"Feather" is a song by American singer Sabrina Carpenter (pictured) from</p>
<p>Emails I Can't Send Fwd:, the 2023 deluxe edition of her fifth studio</p>
<p>album. A dance-pop, disco, and disco-pop song, "Feather" is a post-</p>
<p>breakup track celebrating the freedom and relief one feels upon ending a</p>
<p>relationship. Carpenter co-wrote it with Amy Allen and its producer,</p>
<p>John Ryan. Its production was described as light and airy by music</p>
<p>critics, who thought the song had impact on Carpenter's success the</p>
<p>following year. "Feather" reached number 21 in the US, where it became</p>
<p>her first song to reach the top 40, and was also Carpenter's first</p>
<p>number 1 on the Pop Airplay chart. The music video, which depicts the</p>
<p>deaths of several men who mistreat Carpenter and her dancing at their</p>
<p>joint funeral in a church, caused controversy when the Catholic bishop</p>
<p>of Brooklyn criticized the church scenes and suspended the priest who</p>
<p>allowed them to be filmed. Carpenter performed the song on Saturday</p>
<p>Night Live and on her tours.</p>
