subject: "[Daily article] September 19: Homer Simpson"
---
<p>Homer Simpson is a character in the animated television series The</p>
<p>Simpsons. He is the boorish father of the Simpson family; with his wife,</p>
<p>Marge, he has three children: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. Homer embodies</p>
<p>several American working-class stereotypes: he is overweight, balding,</p>
<p>immature, unintelligent, outspoken, aggressive, lazy, ignorant,</p>
<p>unprofessional, and fond of beer, junk food, and television. Despite his</p>
<p>flaws, he is fundamentally a good-hearted man and fiercely protective of</p>
<p>his family, especially during crises. He was created and designed by</p>
<p>cartoonist Matt Groening and is voiced by Dan Castellaneta (pictured).</p>
<p>Homer is one of the most influential fictional characters on television</p>
<p>and is widely recognized as an American cultural icon. His catchphrase,</p>
<p>the annoyed grunt "D'oh!", has been included in several dictionaries.</p>
<p>Castellaneta has won four Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Voice-</p>
<p>Over Performance, along with a special-achievement Annie Award for</p>
<p>voicing Homer.</p>

<p>Wikiquote quote of the day:</p>
<p></p>
<p>      Before the Second World War I believed in the perfectibility of</p>
<p>social man; that a correct structure of society would produce goodwill;</p>
<p>and that therefore you could remove all social ills by a reorganisation</p>
<p>of society.  … after the war I did not because I was unable to. I had</p>
<p>discovered what one man could do to another. ... I am thinking of the</p>
<p>vileness beyond all words that went on, year after year, in the</p>
<p>totalitarian states. It is bad enough to say that so many Jews were</p>
<p>exterminated in this way and that, so many people liquidated — lovely,</p>
<p>elegant word — but there were things done during that period from</p>
<p>which I still have to avert my mind less I should be physically sick.</p>
<p>They were not done by the headhunters of New Guinea or by some primitive</p>
<p>tribe in the Amazon. They were done, skillfully, coldly, by educated</p>
<p>men, doctors, lawyers, by men with a tradition of civilization behind</p>
<p>them, to beings of their own kind.      </p>
