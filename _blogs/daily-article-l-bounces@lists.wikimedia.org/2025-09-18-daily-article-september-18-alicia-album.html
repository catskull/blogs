---
<p>Alicia is the seventh studio album by Alicia Keys (pictured) and</p>
<p>released on September 18, 2020. Alicia's mostly low-tempo and</p>
<p>melodically subtle music reconciles her experimental direction with bass</p>
<p>drum–driven R&B; and piano-based balladry. The songs explore identity</p>
<p>as a multifaceted concept, sociopolitical concerns, and forms of love</p>
<p>within multiple frameworks. Keys described the album as therapeutic and</p>
<p>reflective of greater introspection in herself. After a surprise</p>
<p>announcement of its impending release in September, Alicia debuted at</p>
<p>number four on the Billboard 200 in its first week and became Keys's</p>
<p>eighth top-10 record in the US, while charting in the top 10 in several</p>
<p>other countries. It received critical praise for Keys's nuanced vocal</p>
<p>performances and the music's broad appeal, while her thematic messages</p>
<p>were considered balanced, healing, and timely against the backdrop of</p>
<p>unfolding world events. The album won the Grammy Award for Best</p>
<p>Immersive Audio Album in 2022.</p>
