<p>Clownfishes are saltwater fishes found in the warm and tropical waters</p>
<p>of the Indo-Pacific. They mainly inhabit coral reefs and have a</p>
<p>distinctive colouration typically consisting of white vertical bars on a</p>
<p>red, orange, yellow, brown or black background. Clownfishes developed a</p>
<p>symbiotic and mutually beneficial relationship with sea anemones, which</p>
<p>they rely on for shelter and protection, while they in turn, clean, fan</p>
<p>and protect them. Clownfishes live in groups consisting of a breeding</p>
<p>female and male, along with some non-breeding individuals. The female</p>
<p>ranks at the top of the hierarchy, followed by the breeding male. The</p>
<p>recognisable colour patterns and social nature of clownfishes have</p>
<p>contributed to their popularity, having appeared in the film Finding</p>
<p>Nemo. They are highly sought after in the aquarium trade and are often</p>
<p>taken from the wild, which has led to their decline.</p>

<p>Wikiquote quote of the day:</p>
<p></p>
<p>      Change is the process by which the future invades our lives, and</p>
<p>it is important to look at it closely, not merely from the grand</p>
<p>perspectives of history, but also from the vantage point of the living,</p>
<p>breathing individuals who experience it.  The acceleration of change in</p>
<p>our time is, itself, an elemental force. This accelerative thrust has</p>
<p>personal and psychological, as well as sociological, consequences.</p>
