subject: "[Daily article] September 14: Mother Solomon"
---
<p>Mother Solomon (1816–1890) was a Wyandot nanny and cultural activist.</p>
<p>Solomon was born along Owl Creek in Marion County, Ohio, to a Wyandot</p>
<p>chief father. In 1822, her family moved to the Big Spring Reservation in</p>
<p>Wyandot County, where elders taught her oral tradition. She learned</p>
<p>English at a mission school and began attending the Wyandot Mission</p>
<p>Church. Solomon married in 1833 and had several children. Some of them</p>
<p>died before 1843, when the Indian Removal Act forced the tribe to move</p>
<p>to Kansas, where they lived in poor conditions. Solomon had more</p>
<p>children there. By 1860, her husband and remaining children had died.</p>
<p>She remarried the Wyandot sheriff John Solomon; they relocated to near</p>
<p>Upper Sandusky, Ohio, in 1865. When John died in 1876, she began</p>
<p>babysitting children, and her village nicknamed her "Mother Solomon".</p>
<p>Solomon promoted Wyandot culture and advocated for the restoration of</p>
<p>the mission church. A popular local figure, her death in 1890 was widely</p>
<p>reported in newspapers.</p>

<p></p>
<p>      Mankind will possess incalculable advantages and extraordinary</p>
<p>control over human behavior when the scientific investigator will be</p>
<p>able to subject his fellow men to the same external analysis he would</p>
<p>employ for any natural object, and when the human mind will contemplate</p>
<p>itself not from within but from without.      </p>
