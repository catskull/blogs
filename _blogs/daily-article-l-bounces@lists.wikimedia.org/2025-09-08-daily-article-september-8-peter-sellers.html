<p>Peter Sellers (8 September 1925 – 24 July 1980) was an English</p>
<p>actor and comedian, known for his many film roles, among them Chief</p>
<p>Inspector Clouseau in The Pink Panther. On stage from early childhood,</p>
<p>he built his skills in Ralph Reader's wartime Gang Show troupe. After</p>
<p>the war, Sellers made his radio debut in ShowTime, and became a regular</p>
<p>on BBC Radio. During the early 1950s, Sellers took part in radio's The</p>
<p>Goon Show. Although the bulk of his film work was comedic, he also</p>
<p>performed in other genres, portraying a wide range of characters even</p>
<p>within the same film. His films include I'm All Right Jack (1959),</p>
<p>Lolita (1962), Dr. Strangelove (1964), What's New Pussycat? (1965),</p>
<p>Casino Royale (1967), Being There (1979) and five films of the Pink</p>
<p>Panther series. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award,</p>
<p>including twice for Best Actor, and won a number of other awards. Turner</p>
<p>Classic Movies called Sellers "one of the most accomplished comic actors</p>
<p>of the late 20th century".</p>

<p>Wikiquote quote of the day:</p>
<p></p>
<p>      Caution's a virtue that o'ercharged is vice,  And dull content is</p>
<p>poverty of soul.  Who shuns offence and holds with neither side,  Who</p>
<p>dreads the deep and never dares to swim,  Who fears to trip and never</p>
<p>tries to run,  May yet in walking stumble.      </p>
