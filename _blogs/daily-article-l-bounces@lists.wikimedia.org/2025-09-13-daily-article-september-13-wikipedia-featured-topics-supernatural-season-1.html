<p>The first season of Supernatural premiered on September 13, 2005, and</p>
<p>concluded on May 4, 2006, after 22 episodes. It focuses on brothers Sam</p>
<p>and Dean Winchester as they track their father, John, who is hunting the</p>
<p>demon who killed their mother and Sam's girlfriend. The brothers use</p>
<p>their father's journal to continue the family business of saving people</p>
<p>and hunting supernatural creatures. Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles</p>
<p>(both pictured) star as Sam and Dean, with Jeffrey Dean Morgan recurring</p>
<p>as John and Nicki Aycox as the demonic Meg Masters. This is the only</p>
<p>season to air on The WB; subsequent seasons aired on The CW. The season</p>
<p>averaged about 3.81 million American viewers and earned many award</p>
<p>nominations, including two Primetime Emmy Awards for work done on the</p>
<p>pilot episode. Some critics criticized the mostly anthology-like format,</p>
<p>while others praised the show's emotional moments and brotherly</p>
<p>chemistry between the lead actors. (This article is part of a featured</p>
