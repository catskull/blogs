<p>During its 1905–06 season, New Brompton F.C., an English football</p>
<p>club, competed in the Southern League Division One. The team began the</p>
<p>season on 2 September 1905 in poor form; they failed to score in six of</p>
<p>their first eight league games and, by midseason, they were near the</p>
<p>bottom of the league table. In the new year, the team won three of its</p>
<p>first seven Southern League games, but failed to score in eight of the</p>
<p>final nine league games. New Brompton finished the season in 17th place</p>
<p>out of 18 teams in the division. They also competed in the FA Cup,</p>
<p>reaching the second round. The team played a total of 37 league and cup</p>
<p>matches, winning 8, drawing 9 and losing 20. Bill Marriott was the</p>
<p>club's top goalscorer, with four goals in the Southern League and one in</p>
<p>the FA Cup. Joe Walton (pictured) made the most appearances, playing in</p>
<p>36 of the team's 37 games. The highest attendance recorded at</p>
<p>Priestfield Road was 5,500 for a game against Portsmouth on 27 January</p>
<p>1906.</p>
