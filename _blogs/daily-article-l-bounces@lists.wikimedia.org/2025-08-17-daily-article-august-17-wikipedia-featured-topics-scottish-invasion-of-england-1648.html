<p>The battle of Preston took place on 17 August 1648. It was part of the</p>
<p>Second English Civil War, which began with a series of mutinies and</p>
<p>Royalist uprisings. The Scots raised an army under the command of James,</p>
<p>Duke of Hamilton, which marched into England to support King Charles I.</p>
<p>It combined with English Royalists and continued south some 24,000</p>
<p>strong. Oliver Cromwell concentrated 9,000 Parliamentarians in north</p>
<p>Yorkshire and fell on the flank of the much larger Royalist army. Not</p>
<p>anticipating this reckless assault, Hamilton was caught with his army</p>
<p>dispersed. A blocking force of Royalist infantry was outflanked after a</p>
<p>ferocious hour-long fight. A second round of prolonged infantry hand-to-</p>
<p>hand fighting took place for control of the bridge south of Preston</p>
<p>(pictured); the Parliamentarians fought their way across as night fell.</p>
<p>In total 1,000 Royalists were killed and 4,000 captured; Parliamentary</p>
<p>casualties were low. (This article is part of a featured topic:</p>

<p>Wikiquote quote of the day:</p>
<p></p>
<p>      Dark to me is the earth. Dark to me are the heavens.  Where is</p>
<p>she that I loved, the woman with eyes like stars?  Desolate are the</p>
<p>streets. Desolate is the city.  A city taken by storm, where none are</p>
<p>left but the slain.      </p>
