<p>Casey Stengel (July 30, 1890 – September 29, 1975) was the manager</p>
<p>of the championship New York Yankees teams of the 1950s and of the New</p>
<p>York Mets of the early 1960s. An outfielder for the 1912 Brooklyn</p>
<p>Dodgers, he played on their 1916 National League championship team, then</p>
<p>for the Philadelphia Phillies, the New York Giants and the Boston</p>
<p>Braves. In 1925, he began a career as a manager, with mostly poor</p>
<p>finishes for the next 20 years. In 1948, after he won the PCL title with</p>
<p>the Oakland Oaks, the Yankees hired him. In his twelve seasons, they won</p>
<p>ten pennants and seven World Series, including a record-setting five in</p>
<p>a row (1949–1953), but Stengel was fired after losing the 1960 World</p>
<p>Series. The Mets were an expansion team when they hired him in late</p>
<p>1961. They finished last all four seasons with Stengel, and he retired</p>
<p>in 1965. Remembered as one of the great characters in baseball history,</p>
<p>and known for his humorous sayings, Stengel was elected to the Baseball</p>
<p>Hall of Fame in 1966.</p>

<p></p>
<p>      Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed</p>
<p>about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing</p>
<p>accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee. But these speak evil of</p>
<p>those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute</p>
<p>beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.      </p>
