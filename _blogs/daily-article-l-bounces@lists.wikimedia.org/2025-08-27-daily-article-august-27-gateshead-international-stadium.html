<p>Gateshead International Stadium is a multi-purpose, all-seater venue in</p>
<p>Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, England, built in 1955. The largest stadium in</p>
<p>the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead, it has a history of use for</p>
<p>athletics events, sports, and musical performances. Gateshead Harriers</p>
<p>Athletic Club (which includes Jonathan Edwards) have used the site since</p>
<p>1956. At the 1974 "Gateshead Games", Brendan Foster broke the world</p>
<p>record in the men's 3,000 metres. It has since hosted the British Grand</p>
<p>Prix (2003–2010) and the European Athletics Team Championships in</p>
<p>1989, 2000 and 2013. Five world records have been set at the stadium,</p>
<p>including two by pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva and a tied 100 metres</p>
<p>record by Asafa Powell in 2006. It has been used by Gateshead F.C. and</p>
<p>its predecessors since 1973. The stadium was home to the rugby league</p>
<p>club Gateshead Thunder during their spell in the Super League, and the</p>
<p>replacement Gateshead Thunder club played home games in the main arena</p>
<p>until 2015.</p>
