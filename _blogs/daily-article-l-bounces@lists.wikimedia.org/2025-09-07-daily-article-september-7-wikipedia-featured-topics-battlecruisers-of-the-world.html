<p>HMS Queen Mary was the last battlecruiser built by the Royal Navy</p>
<p>before the First World War. The sole member of her class, Queen Mary was</p>
<p>completed in 1913. She never left the North Sea once the war started,</p>
<p>participating in the Battle of Heligoland Bight in 1914 as part of the</p>
<p>Grand Fleet. Queen Mary unsuccessfully attempted to intercept a German</p>
<p>force that bombarded the North Sea coast of England that December. She</p>
<p>was refitting in early 1915 and missed the Battle of Dogger Bank in</p>
<p>January. Queen Mary was sunk in the largest fleet action of the war, the</p>
<p>Battle of Jutland, in mid-1916. Twice hit by the German battlecruiser</p>
<p>Derfflinger during the early part of the battle, her magazines exploded,</p>
<p>sinking her. The wreck was discovered in 1991 and rests in pieces on the</p>
<p>floor of the North Sea. Her wreck is designated as a protected place</p>
<p>under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 as it is the grave of</p>
<p>1,266 men. (This article is part of a featured topic: Battlecruisers of</p>

<p></p>
<p>      Anyone who is passionate about what they do will have a better</p>
<p>chance of connecting with future generations than those who simply</p>
<p>follow transient trends. At least their work will have a distinctive</p>
<p>character, and this is what people respond to, I believe.      </p>
