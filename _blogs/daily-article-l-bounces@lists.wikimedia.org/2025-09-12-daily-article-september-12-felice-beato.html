<p>Felice Beato (c. 1832 – 1909) was an Italian-British photographer.</p>
<p>He was one of the first to take photographs in East Asia and one of the</p>
<p>first war photographers. He is noted for his genre works, portraits, and</p>
<p>views and panoramas of the architecture and landscapes of Asia and the</p>
<p>Mediterranean region. His travels let him create images of countries,</p>
<p>people and events that were unfamiliar and remote to most people in</p>
<p>Europe and North America. His work provides images of such events as the</p>
<p>Indian Rebellion of 1857 and the Second Opium War, and represents the</p>
<p>first substantial body of photojournalism. Beato was the official</p>
<p>photographer of the Nile Expedition led by G. J. Wolseley to Khartoum,</p>
<p>Sudan, in relief of General Charles Gordon. Beato influenced other</p>
<p>photographers; and his impact in Japan, where he taught and worked with</p>
<p>other photographers and artists, was particularly deep and lasting. He</p>
<p>pioneered and refined the techniques of hand-colouring photographs and</p>
<p>making panoramas.</p>

<p>Wikiquote quote of the day:</p>
<p></p>
<p>      Faith as well as science endowed the visible world with</p>
<p>properties that eliminated blind, incalculable chance as the author of</p>
<p>all events. The war of good and evil present in all religions does not</p>
<p>always end, in every faith, with the victory of good, but in every one</p>
<p>it establishes a clear order of existence. The sacred as well as the</p>
<p>profane rests on that universal order...      </p>
