<p>Zhao Chongguo (137 BCE – 52 BCE) was a Chinese military commander</p>
<p>and official during the Western Han dynasty. Emperor Wu, impressed by</p>
<p>Zhao's military service, promoted him, and he served as chief of staff</p>
<p>for the supreme head of cavalry units. In 74 BCE, Zhao collaborated</p>
<p>with the political leader Huo Guang to depose the newly enthroned</p>
<p>emperor Liu He in favor of Emperor Xuan. For this, he was appointed</p>
<p>Marquis of Yingping and promoted to general of the rear. He volunteered</p>
<p>to lead a campaign against the Qiang people in 62 BCE. Joined by his</p>
<p>son, he persuaded the Qiang to defect to the Han cause. Zhao rejected</p>
<p>proposals by his fellow generals and the Emperor to continue offensive</p>
<p>operations, believing that a protracted occupation would subdue the</p>
<p>Qiang through attrition. He was able to implement a policy of tuntian</p>
<p>(farming garrisons) in spite of imperial opposition. This gained him</p>
<p>acclaim and influenced later tacticians. He retired in 60 BCE after his</p>
<p>son caused a scandal.</p>
