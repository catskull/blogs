subject: "[Daily article] August 29: Harriet Leveson-Gower, Countess Granville"
---
<p>Harriet Leveson-Gower, Countess Granville (29 August 1785 –</p>
<p>25 November 1862), was a British society hostess and writer. The</p>
<p>younger daughter of Lady Georgiana Spencer and the 5th Duke of</p>
<p>Devonshire, she was a member of the wealthy Cavendish and Spencer</p>
<p>families. In 1809, Harriet married Granville Leveson-Gower, a diplomat</p>
<p>who had been her maternal aunt's lover for seventeen years. During</p>
<p>intermittent periods between 1824 and 1841, Granville served as the</p>
<p>British ambassador to France, requiring Harriet to perform an array of</p>
<p>social duties in Paris that she often found exhausting. A prolific</p>
<p>writer of letters, Harriet corresponded with others for most of her</p>
<p>life, often describing her observations of those around her. Historians</p>
<p>have since found her detailed accounts to be a valuable source of</p>
<p>information on life as an ambassadress as well as life in the 19th-</p>
<p>century aristocracy. Between 1894 and 1990, four edited collections of</p>
<p>Harriet's correspondence were published.</p>
