<p>"Dance the Night" is a song by Dua Lipa (pictured) from the soundtrack</p>
<p>to the 2023 fantasy comedy film Barbie. Lipa co-wrote the song with</p>
<p>songwriter Caroline Ailin and its producers Andrew Wyatt and Mark</p>
<p>Ronson. A disco, disco-pop, and synth-pop song with influences of dance-</p>
<p>pop, it was inspired by a dance sequence in the film and is about always</p>
<p>appearing perfect externally. Music critics overwhelmingly compared the</p>
<p>sound of "Dance the Night" to Lipa's album Future Nostalgia (2020),</p>
<p>which was viewed positively by some while others were disappointed. The</p>
<p>song was nominated for the Grammy Awards for Song of the Year and Best</p>
<p>Song Written for Visual Media. It reached number one in several</p>
<p>countries, including the UK, and received multi-platinum certifications</p>
<p>in others. The music video intersperses Lipa performing choreography</p>
<p>with clips from a disco party in the film. The song was included as the</p>
<p>primary musical motif in the film, and she performed it for the first</p>
<p>time at the Royal Albert Hall in 2024.</p>
