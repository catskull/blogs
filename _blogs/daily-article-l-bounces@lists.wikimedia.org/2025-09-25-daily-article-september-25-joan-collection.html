subject: "[Daily article] September 25: Joan (collection)"
---
<p>Joan (Autumn/Winter 1998) was the twelfth collection by British fashion</p>
<p>designer Alexander McQueen for his eponymous fashion house. Continuing</p>
<p>his dual fascination with religion and violence, it was inspired by</p>
<p>imagery of persecution, most significantly the 1431 martyrdom of Joan of</p>
<p>Arc, who was burned at the stake. The collection's palette was mainly</p>
<p>red, black and silver; colours which evoked notions of warfare, death,</p>
<p>blood and flames. Many looks referenced ecclesiastical garments and</p>
<p>medieval armour, including items that mimicked chainmail and one</p>
<p>ensemble that had silver-plated armour pieces. The runway show was</p>
<p>staged in London. The set design was sparse and industrial: a dark room</p>
<p>lit by metal lamps suspended over the runway. The 100-foot (30 m)</p>
<p>runway was covered in black ashes, and models entered through a black</p>
<p>backdrop backlit in red. Ninety-one looks were presented; primarily</p>
<p>womenswear with some menswear. Critical response to the clothing and the</p>
<p>runway show was positive.</p>

<p>Wikiquote quote of the day:</p>
<p></p>
<p>      Maybe the silver lining from this is we found one thing we can</p>
<p>agree on, and maybe we'll even find another one. Maybe we can get a</p>
<p>little bit closer together. We do agree on a lot of things. We agree on</p>
<p>keeping our children safe from guns, on reproductive rights for women,</p>
<p>Social Security, affordable health care, pediatric cancer research.</p>
<p>These are all things that most Americans support. Let's stop letting</p>
<p>these politicians tell us what they want and tell them what we want.</p>
<p>There was a moment over the weekend, a very beautiful moment. I don't</p>
<p>know if you saw this on Sunday. Erika Kirk forgave the man who shot her</p>
<p>husband. She forgave him. That is an example we should follow. If you</p>
<p>believe in the teachings of Jesus as I do, there it was. That's, that's</p>
<p>it. A selfless act of grace, forgiveness from a grieving widow. It</p>
<p>touched me deeply, and I hope it touches many, and if there's anything</p>
<p>we should take from this tragedy to carry forward, I hope it can be that</p>
<p>and not this.      </p>
