<p>Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There is a novel</p>
<p>published in December 1871 by Lewis Carroll, a mathematics lecturer at</p>
<p>the University of Oxford. It was the sequel to his Alice's Adventures in</p>
<p>Wonderland (1865), in which many of the characters were playing-cards;</p>
<p>in this novel the theme is chess. As in the earlier book, the central</p>
<p>figure, Alice, finds herself in a fantastical universe. She passes</p>
<p>through a large mirror into another world and finds that, just as in a</p>
<p>reflection, things there are reversed, including logic. Eventually,</p>
<p>after a succession of strange adventures, she wakes and realises she has</p>
<p>been dreaming. The original illustrations are by John Tenniel. The book</p>
<p>contains several verse passages and, like Alice's Adventures in</p>
<p>Wonderland, introduces phrases that have become common currency. Through</p>
<p>the Looking Glass has been adapted for the stage and screen and</p>
<p>translated into many languages. Critical opinion of the book has</p>
<p>generally been favourable.</p>
