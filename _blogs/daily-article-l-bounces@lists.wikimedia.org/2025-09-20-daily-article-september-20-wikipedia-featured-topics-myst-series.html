<p>Myst V: End of Ages is a 2005 adventure video game, developed by Cyan</p>
<p>Worlds, published by Ubisoft, and released for Macintosh and Windows PC</p>
<p>platforms. Directed by Rand Miller (pictured) it is the fifth</p>
<p>installment in the Myst series. Like in past entries, gameplay consists</p>
<p>of navigating worlds known as "Ages" via the use of special books and</p>
<p>items which act as portals. End of Ages replaces pre-rendered</p>
<p>environments used in past games with worlds rendered in real-time 3D</p>
<p>graphics, allowing easy navigation. It also includes an in-game camera.</p>
<p>Additionally, the faces of actors were digitally mapped onto three-</p>
<p>dimensional character models. End of Ages was positively received,</p>
<p>despite complaints such as lessened interactivity compared to previous</p>
<p>games and poorer graphics. After the game's release Cyan announced the</p>
<p>end of software development and the layoff of most of its staff, but was</p>
<p>able to rehire much of the development team a few weeks later.</p>
