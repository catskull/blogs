<p>Tumbler Ridge is a district municipality in the foothills of the B.C.</p>
<p>Rockies in northeastern British Columbia, Canada, and a member</p>
<p>municipality of the Peace River Regional District. With a population of</p>
<p>2,399 in 2021, the municipality encompasses an area of 1,558 km2</p>
<p>(602 sq mi). Located near the confluence of the Murray River and</p>
<p>Flatbed Creek and the intersection of Highways 52 and 29, it is part of</p>
<p>the Peace River South provincial electoral district and the Prince</p>
<p>George—Peace River—Northern Rockies federal riding. It is a planned</p>
<p>community, with the housing and infrastructure built simultaneously in</p>
<p>1981 by the provincial government to service the coal industry. After</p>
<p>dinosaur footprints and fossils were discovered in the municipality,</p>
<p>along with fossils of Triassic fishes and Cretaceous plants, the Peace</p>
<p>Region Paleontology Research Center opened in 2003. The study of the</p>
<p>area led to a recognition of its geological importance and listing in</p>
<p>the UNESCO Global Geopark Network.</p>

<p>Wikiquote quote of the day:</p>
<p></p>
<p>      Marriage is the clue to human life, but there is no marriage</p>
<p>apart from the wheeling sun and the nodding earth, from the straying of</p>
<p>the planets and the magnificence of the fixed stars. Is not a man</p>
<p>different, utterly different, at dawn from what he is at sunset? And a</p>
<p>woman too? And does not the changing harmony and discord of their</p>
<p>variation make the secret music of life?      </p>
