---
<p>Joseph Francis Shea (September 5, 1925 – February 14, 1999) was an</p>
<p>American aerospace engineer and NASA manager. After working for Bell</p>
<p>Labs on the radio inertial guidance system of the Titan I</p>
<p>intercontinental ballistic missile, he was hired by NASA in 1961. As</p>
<p>Deputy Director of NASA's Office of Manned Space Flight, and later as</p>
<p>head of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, Shea led NASA to decide in</p>
<p>favor of lunar orbit rendezvous and supporting "all up" testing of the</p>
<p>Saturn V rocket. Deeply involved in the investigation of the 1967</p>
<p>Apollo 1 fire, Shea suffered from stress. He was moved to an</p>
<p>alternative position in Washington and left NASA shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>>From 1968 until 1990 he was a senior manager at Raytheon in Lexington,</p>
<p>Massachusetts, then worked as an adjunct professor of aeronautics and</p>
<p>astronautics at MIT. Shea served as a consultant for NASA on the</p>
<p>redesign of the International Space Station in 1993, but resigned due to</p>
<p>health issues.</p>

<p>Wikiquote quote of the day:</p>
<p></p>
<p>      The old adage that polite conversation should not include talk of</p>
<p>politics or religion is understandable because both subjects are so</p>
<p>heavily laden with emotion that discussion can quickly turn to shouting.</p>
<p>Blood is shed over politics, religion and the two in combination.      </p>
