---
<p>The Stockton and Darlington Railway (S&DR;), the world's first public</p>
<p>railway to use steam locomotives, first operated on 27 September 1825.</p>
<p>It initially connected collieries near Shildon with Darlington and</p>
<p>Stockton in County Durham, north-east England. The transport of coal</p>
<p>proved profitable, and the line was soon extended to a new port at</p>
<p>Middlesbrough. The opening of the S&DR; was seen as proof of steam</p>
<p>railway effectiveness. While coal was hauled by steam locomotives,</p>
<p>horses drew passenger coaches along the rails until carriages hauled by</p>
<p>locomotives were introduced in 1833. The S&DR; suffered severe financial</p>
<p>difficulties at the end of the 1840s but the discovery of iron ore in</p>
<p>Cleveland led to an increase in revenue. At the beginning of the 1860s</p>
<p>it took over railways that had crossed the Pennines, but was itself</p>
<p>taken over by the North Eastern Railway, continuing to operate</p>
<p>independently until 1876. Much of the original route is now served by</p>
<p>the Tees Valley line.</p>

<p>Wikiquote quote of the day:</p>
<p></p>
<p>      Neither the wisest constitution nor the wisest laws will secure</p>
<p>the liberty and happiness of a people whose manners are universally</p>
<p>corrupt. He therefore is the truest friend to the liberty of his country</p>
<p>who tries most to promote its virtue, and who, so far as his power and</p>
<p>influence extend, will not suffer a man to be chosen into any office of</p>
<p>power and trust who is not a wise and virtuous man. We must not conclude</p>
<p>merely upon a man's haranguing upon liberty, and using the charming</p>
<p>sound, that he is fit to be trusted with the liberties of his country.</p>
<p>It is not unfrequent to hear men declaim loudly upon liberty, who, if we</p>
<p>may judge by the whole tenor of their actions, mean nothing else by it</p>
<p>but their own liberty, — to oppress without control or the restraint</p>
<p>of laws all who are poorer or weaker than themselves.      </p>
