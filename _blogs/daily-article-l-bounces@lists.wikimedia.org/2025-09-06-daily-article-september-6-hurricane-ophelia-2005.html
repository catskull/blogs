subject: "[Daily article] September 6: Hurricane Ophelia (2005)"
---
<p>Hurricane Ophelia was a long-lived tropical cyclone, the fifteenth named</p>
<p>storm and the eighth hurricane of the record-breaking 2005 Atlantic</p>
<p>hurricane season. Classified as a tropical depression on September 6,</p>
<p>it moved along a looping course, tending north. It reached hurricane</p>
<p>status on September 8, though it repeatedly lost and regained it. The</p>
<p>system reached hurricane strength for the fourth time on September 14,</p>
<p>with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (140 km/h). Ophelia had</p>
<p>completed a second loop and was moving northwest toward North Carolina.</p>
<p>It mostly remained offshore though its eyewall scraped the coastline for</p>
<p>two days. It degraded to tropical storm strength on September 16 as it</p>
<p>began accelerating northeast. Ophelia traversed Atlantic Canada before</p>
<p>dissipating on September 23 over the Norwegian Sea. With the storm</p>
<p>occurring on the heels of Hurricane Katrina, governments were quick to</p>
<p>prepare shelters. Three people died as the result of the storm, with</p>
<p>another missing.</p>
